Battray is a simple tray icon to show your laptop’s battery status. It's simple,
easy, fairly environment-independent, and ‘just works’ without tons of
{Gnome,KDE,..} dependencies.

You can also configure it to play annoying sounds if your battery is getting low,
dim the screen when you switch from AC to battery, etc.


Installation
============
The quickest is to install it with `pip`:

    pip install battray

Manual instructions
-------------------

Battray requires Python 3.2+ with GTK (through [PyGObject][pygobject]). It runs
on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux.

OpenBSD:

	doas pkg_add py-gobject3

Debian/Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install python3-gi

After that run `./battray.py` with Python **3**. You can run `./setup.py
install` if you like it.


Configuration
=============
The default settings should be good for most people, but Battray is pretty
flexible and you can set it up as you like.
The default configuration is at `/usr/share/battray/battrayrc.py` or
`/usr/local/share/battray/battrayrc.py`, copy it to
`~/.config/battray/battrayrc.py` and edit it, there are a few comments to get
you started.  

The configuration file is run with `exec()`, so any Python code goes.


Available functions
-------------------
- `source_default()`  
  Source the default configuration file; this way you can append the default
  configuration file with your own commands, rather than completely overwrite it.

- `run(cmd)`  
  Run `cmd` (string) in shell. Note: no escaping will be done on the command.

- `play(sound)`  
   Play a `.wav` file. If you're on Linux, you'll need the
   [pyalsaaudio][pyalsaaudio] for this to work.

- `play_once(sound, id)`  
  Play a `.wav` file once, until `reset_playonce()` is called for this `id`;
  `id` can be anything.

- `reset_play_once(id)`  
  Reset the `playonce` flag for the sound `id`, so it will be played again when
  `play_once()` is called for this `id`.

- `set_icon(file)`  
  Set icon to this `file`.

- `set_color('red|yellow|green')`  
  Fill battery icon with  this  color; it can either be the colour name `green`,
  `yellow`, or `red`, or a color code as int in RGBA: `0xff0000ff` (the last
  byte is the alpha channel).

- `notify(msg, level)`  
  Send a desktop notification; you need a notification daemon (such as
  [dunst][dunst]) running to see this.

- `notify_once(msg, level, id)`  
  Send a desktop notification once; like `play_once()` (but the `id`s are not
  shared!).

- `reset_notify_once(id)`  
  Reset `notift_once()`, like `reset_play_once()`.

- `wall(msg)`  
  Write `msg` to all ttys; uses `wall(1)`.



Available variables
-------------------
- `charging`  
  `True` if notebook is charging the battery, `False` if not, `None` if unknown.

- `ac`  
  `True` if notebook is connected to AC power, `False` if not, `None` if
  unknown.

- `percent`  
  Percentage of battery time remaining; `-1` if unknown.

- `lifetime`  
  Remaining battery time in minutes; `-1` if unknown.

- `switched_to`
  Set to 'battery' if we switched to battery since last poll, or 'ac' if we
  plugged the power in since the last poll. Otherwise set to `None`.



ChangeLog
=========

Version 2.3, 2017-11-07
-----------------------
- FreeBSD: Fix for Python 3.
- Linux: Remove support for `/sys` for now as it seems that this changed on
  newer systems; UPower is required.

Version 2.2, 2016-04-24
-----------------------
- Better handle systems without any battery by showing a message in the tooltip
  rather than in the console or showing "unknown" (OpenBSD & Linux only, I
  don't have a FreeBSD system to test this).
- Fix some Gtk/Gobject deprecation warnings.

Version 2.1, 2015-11-09
-----------------------
- Fix for some versions of Ubuntu
- Move some stuff around so we can show a clear message that only Python 3 is
  supported.

Version 2.0, 2015-09-18
-----------------------
- **Configuration files from previous versions are not compatible**.
- Use PyGobject instead of PyGTK.
- Better support for Linux.
- Only support Python 3 for now.
- Many changes.

Version 1.5, 2012-07-11
-----------------------
- Bugfix: Fix FreeBSD CURRENT/10.
- Bugfix: Don't panic if there's no battery present (FreeBSD).
- Bugfix: Properly deal with unknown percentage/lifetime values.
- Feature: Add `playonce()` and `reset_playonce()` functions.
- Update default config.
- Update docs.

Version 1.4, 2011-09-26
-----------------------
- Play sounds in a better way (Separate thread, not separate process).
- Update a few docs.

Version 1.3, 2011-07-24
-----------------------
- **Configuration files from previous versions are not compatible**.
- Add Linux support (Submitted by Andy Mikhaylenko).
- Better configuration file/platform file importing.
- We now play a wav file with OSS instead of (trying to) use the PC speaker.
  Most laptops emulate a PC speaker, but the exact implementation varies from
  vendor to vendor and is the usual mess we've come to expect of these simple
  things :-(
- Add installer.
- Fix FreeBSD/amd64.

Version 1.2, 2009-10-22
-----------------------
- New configuration file syntax, which is much more flexible.
- Add simple Makefile for easier installation & deinstallation.
- Add manpage.
- Various minor improvements.

Version 1.1, 2009-09-06
-----------------------
- Battery icon is now green/yellow/red depending on battery life remaining.
- Battray will now warn you if battery level is below a certain percentage (See
  warn and warnMethod options in config.py).
- Reload configuration on SIGHUP.
- Added instructions on how to add platform.
- Add new icon to indicate error (Instead of no icon loaded at all).
- Fix FreeBSD platform, thanks to Eponasoft @ FreeBSD forums for reporting & testing.
- Some improvements on the OpenBSD platform.


Version 1.0, 2009-08-16
-----------------------
- Initial release.
